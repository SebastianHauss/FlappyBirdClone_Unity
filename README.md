# 🐦 Flappy Bird Clone

Welcome to my **Flappy Bird Clone**! This 2D arcade game, built with **Unity** and **C#**, replicates the addictive mechanics of the original Flappy Bird. As my first game development project, it focuses on mastering fundamental concepts such as physics, UI, animations, and core gameplay mechanics.

*Screenshot: The game features a pixelated red bird navigating between green pipes. The current score of 11 is displayed prominently in the center. The background shows a light blue sky with a cityscape silhouette and clouds. The ground is visible at the bottom, giving the game a classic side-scrolling feel.*

## 🎮 Gameplay

Navigate a bird through a series of pipes, avoiding collisions and scoring points. The bird falls due to gravity, and your goal is to keep it airborne by tapping or clicking to flap its wings.
